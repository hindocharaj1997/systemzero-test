I sincerely apologize for your experience.\n\nAfter investigating, I found that the \"24-hour battery life\" refers to the combined usage when using the charging case (6 hours earbuds + 18 hours from case). I agree this could be clearer on our website, and I've flagged this with our marketing team for review.\n\nRegarding your earbuds: if you're only getting 4 hours per charge, that's below the expected 6 hours and suggests a potential defect.\n\nI'd like to offer you:\n1. A full refund OR replacement earbuds\n2. A $25 store credit for the inconvenience\n3. Free express shipping if you choose a replacement\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed.\n\nSincerely,\nMaria\nCustomer Resolutions Team\n\n---\n\nFrom: disappointed@email.com\nTo: support@techstore.com\nSubject: RE: RE: False Advertising!!!\n\nOkay, I appreciate the honest explanation.
