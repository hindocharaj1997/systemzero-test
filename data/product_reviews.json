      "review_text": "The chair itself is comfortable and well-built. BUT the assembly was a nightmare. Instructions were confusing, some screws were mislabeled, and it took 3 hours instead of the advertised 45 minutes. Had to watch YouTube videos to figure it out. Chair is great once assembled though.",
