Subject: RE: False Advertising!!!

Dear Customer,

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I sincerely apologize for your experience.

After investigating, I found that the ""24-hour battery life"" refers to the combined usage when using the charging case (6 hours earbuds + 18 hours from case). I agree this could be clearer on our website, and I've flagged this with our marketing team for review.

Regarding your earbuds: if you're only getting 4 hours per charge, that's below the expected 6 hours and suggests a potential defect.

I'd like to offer you:
1. A full refund OR replacement earbuds
2. A $25 store credit for the inconvenience
3. Free express shipping if you choose a replacement

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Sincerely,
