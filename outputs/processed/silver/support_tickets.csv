Agent: I'd be happy to help. What error message are you seeing?

Customer: It says 'Connection failed - incorrect password' but I'm 100% sure the password is correct.

Agent: That's a common issue. Let's try a few things. First, is your WiFi network name visible in the TV's list?

Customer: Yes, it shows up.

Agent: Good. Sometimes the issue is with special characters. Does your WiFi password have any symbols like @, #, or &?

Customer: Yes, it has an @ symbol.

Agent: That might be the culprit. Some smart TVs have trouble with certain special characters in passwords. I'd recommend temporarily changing your WiFi password to something with only letters and numbers, connecting the TV, and then you can change it back.

Customer: Okay, let me try... [pause] ... It's connecting now!
