Just to make sure I understand - they're physically working fine, just not comfortable for you?\"}, {\"timestamp\": \"00:01:08\", \"speaker\": \"customer\", \"text\": \"Right. The sound quality is great, but they press too hard on my ears. After about an hour, it starts to hurt.\"}, {\"timestamp\": \"00:01:17\", \"speaker\": \"agent\", \"text\": \"I understand completely. Comfort is really personal when it comes to headphones. I can process a return for you, or if you're interested, I could suggest an alternative model that might be more comfortable?\"}, {\"timestamp\": \"00:01:30\", \"speaker\": \"customer\", \"text\": \"Actually, yes, I'd be interested in hearing about alternatives. I really did like the noise cancellation.\"}, {\"timestamp\": \"00:01:38\", \"speaker\": \"agent\", \"text\": \"Great! We have the EarPods Pro that have the same excellent noise cancellation, but they're earbuds instead of over-ear, so no pressure on the ears at all. Or there's the ComfortMax Headphones which have extra cushioning and a looser fit.\"}, {\"timestamp\": \"00:01:55\", \"speaker\": \"customer\", \"text\": \"The EarPods Pro sound interesting. Are they similar in price?\"}, {\"timestamp\": \"00:02:00\", \"speaker\": \"agent\", \"text\": \"They're actually $30 less than what you paid for the Noise-Canceling Headset, so you'd get that difference refunded back to you.\"}, {\"timestamp\": \"00:02:10\", \"speaker\": \"customer\", \"text\": \"Oh nice! Yeah, let's do an exchange for those then.\"}, {\"timestamp\": \"00:02:15\", \"speaker\": \"agent\", \"text\": \"Perfect choice! Let me set that up for you. I'll email you a prepaid return label for the headset.

Once we receive the return - usually takes 3-5 days after you ship it - we'll process everything within 24 hours. So you should have your new EarPods Pro within about 10 days total.\"}, {\"timestamp\": \"00:02:50\", \"speaker\": \"customer\", \"text\": \"Perfect.
